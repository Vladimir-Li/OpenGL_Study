# *OpenGL Study* 

### <img src="opengl.jpg">

I am studying OpenGL acording to [this](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/) website and also with a little help of Youtube.\
Learning this requirs some level of math (espically linear algebra), so a open course like [this](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm) can be really helpful.
